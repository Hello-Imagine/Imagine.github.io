			<p>Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.Machine learning-based solutions have been successfully employed for the automatic detection of malware on Android.</p>
			
			<h2>Deep Learning</h2>
			<p>Deep learning (DL) is a machine learning method based on the representation of data, which can simulate the neural structure of human brain. Its motivation is to build and simulate the neural network of human brain for analysis and learning, and imitate the mechanism of human brain to interpret data, such as image, sound and text. Deep learning puts forward a method to let the computer automatically learn the pattern features, and integrates the feature learning into the process of modeling, so as to reduce the incompleteness caused by artificial design features. At present, some machine learning applications with deep learning as the core have achieved the recognition or classification performance beyond the existing algorithms in the application scenarios that meet specific conditions. Deep learning, can let the computer have the same wisdom as human, its development prospect is infinite.</p>
			
			<h2>Reinforcement learning</h2>
			<p>Reinforcement learning (RL), also known as reinforcement learning, evaluation learning or reinforcement learning, is one of the paradigms and methodologies of machine learning. It is used to describe and solve the problem that agents achieve the maximum return or achieve specific goals through learning strategies in the process of interaction with the environment. A common model of reinforcement learning is the standard Markov decision process (MDP). The variants of reinforcement learning include reverse reinforcement learning, hierarchical reinforcement learning and partially observable reinforcement learning.</p>
			
			<h2>Deep Reinforcement learning</h2>
			<p>Deep learning has strong perception ability, but it lacks certain decision-making ability; while reinforcement learning has decision-making ability, and it has nothing to do with perception problems. Deep learning model can be used in reinforcement learning to form deep reinforcement learning. Therefore, the combination of the two provides a new way to solve the problem of feature extraction in malicious code detection.</p>
			<p><b>Nowadays, network attacks tend to be refined, and malicious code is changing rapidly. The malicious code model based on artificial intelligence has attracted more and more attention from academia and many security companies. Our project will be based on in-depth study of deep reinforcement learning and other related knowledge in the field of artificial intelligence, and explore new ideas of using deep learning technology to solve Android malware detection.</b></p>
